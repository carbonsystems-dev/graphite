# Graphite
## What is it?
Graphite is a JS library made to make the lives of developers easier. We understand that localstorage can be hard for newer devs, so we have worked to fix that issue! Graphite is a feature rich library that allows for seamless integration and ease of access usage. Its very simple to use and I hope you plan on using it for your project!
